# MSsetupscript
Simple Powershell script that automatically runs, confirms, and installs various .msi files and Windows updates. Directly after this script is ran, the device is joined to Azure AD. It's not the prettiest but it performs everything it needs to.
Endpoint download links like Datto RMM or Connect Wise are omitted and need to be added manually

Thing(s) that could be improved:

-Pinning the necessary Office 365 applications and downloaded apps to the task bar
